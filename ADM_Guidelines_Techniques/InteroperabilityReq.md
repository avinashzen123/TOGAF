# 25. Interoperability Requirements

the ability to share information and services

Defining the degree to which the information and services are to be shared is a very useful architectural requirement, especially in a complex organization and/or extended enterprise.

The determination of interoperability is present throughout the Architecture Development Method (ADM) as follows:

1. Phase A : the nature and security considerations of the information and service exchanges are first revealed within the business scenarios
2. Phase B : the information and service exchanges are further defined in business terms
3. Data Architecture (Phase C): the content of the information exchanges is detailed using the corporate data and/or information exchange model
4. Application Architecture (Phase C): the way that the various applications are to share the information and services is specified
5. Technology Architecture (Phase D): the appropriate technical mechanisms to permit the information and service exchanges are specified
6. Opportunities & Solutions (Phase E): the actual solutions (e.g., Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) packages) are selected
7. Migration Planning (Phase F): the interoperability is logically implemented

## Defining Interoperability
There are many ways to define interoperability and the aim is to define one that is consistently applied within the enterprise and extended enterprise. It is best that both the enterprise and the extended enterprise use the same definitions.

Many organizations find it useful to categorize interoperability as follows:
- **Operational or Business Interoperability** defines how business processes are to be shared
- **Information Interoperability** defines how information is to be shared
- **Technical Interoperability** defines how technical services are to be shared or at least connect to one another

From an IT perspective, it is also useful to consider interoperability in a similar vein to Enterprise Application Integration (EAI); specifically:
- **Presentation Integration/Interoperability** is where a common look-and-feel approach through a common portal-like solution guides the user to the underlying functionality of the set of systems
- **Information Integration/Interoperability** is where the corporate information is seamlessly shared between the various corporate applications to achieve, for example, a common set of client information
- **Application Integration/Interoperability** is where the corporate functionality is integrated and shareable so that the applications are not duplicated (e.g., one change of address service/component; not one for every application) and are seamlessly linked together through functionality such as workflow 
- **Technical Integration/Interoperability** includes common methods and shared services for the communication, storage, processing, and access to data primarily in the application platform and communications infrastructure domains

Many organizations create their own interoperability models, such as illustrated in the example below from the Canadian Government. 

Their interoperability breakdown is as follows:

- Information Interoperability:
    - Knowledge management
    - Business intelligence
    - Information management
    - Trusted identity
- Business Interoperability:
    - Delivery networks
    - e-Democracy
    - e-Business
    - Enterprise resource management
    - Relationship and case management

- Technical Interoperability:
    - IT infrastructure


## Enterprise Operating Model
Key to establishing interoperability is the determination of the corporate operating model, where the operating model is "the necessary level of business process integration and standardization for delivering goods and services to customers

An operating model describes how a company wants to thrive and grow. By providing a more stable and actionable view of the company than strategy, the operating model drives the design of the foundation for execution."

## Refining Interoperability
Implementing interoperability requires the creation, management, acceptance, and enforcement of realistic standards that are SMART (Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Realistic, and Time-bound). Clear measures of interoperability are key to success.

Architecture is the key for identifying standards and facilitated sessions (brainstorming) will examine potential pragmatic ways (that fit within the current or emerging business culture) to achieve the requisite degree of interoperability
