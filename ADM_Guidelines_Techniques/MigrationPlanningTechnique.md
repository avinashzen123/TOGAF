# 24. Migration Planning Techniques

1. **Implementation Factor Assessment & Deduction Matrix**
    document factors impacting the architecture Implementation and Migration Plan.

    The matrix should include a list of the factors to be considered, their descriptions, and the deductions that indicate the actions or constraints that have to be taken into consideration when formulating the plans.

    Factors typically include:

        - Risks
        - Issues
        - Assumptions
        - Dependencies
        - Actions
        - Impacts


2. **Consolidated Gaps, Solutions, & Dependencies Matrix**
    The technique of creating a Consolidated Gaps, Solutions, and Dependencies matrix allows the architect to group the gaps identified in the domain architecture gap analysis results and assess potential solutions and dependencies to one or more gaps.

    This matrix can be used as a planning tool when creating work packages. The identified dependencies will drive the creation of projects and migration planning in Phases E and F.


3. **Architecture Definition Increments Table**
    The technique of creating an Architecture Definition Increments table allows the architect to plan a series of Transition Architectures outlining the status of the Enterprise Architecture at specified times.

4. **Transition Architecture State Evolution Table**
    The technique of creating the Transition Architecture State Evolution table allows the architect to show the proposed state of the architectures at various levels using the defined taxonomy (e.g., the TOGAF TRM).

    A table should be drawn, listing the services from the taxonomy used in the enterprise, the Transition Architectures, and proposed transformations

5. **Business Value Assessment Technique**
    A technique to assess business value is to draw up a matrix based on a value index dimension and a risk index dimension

    The value index should include criteria such as compliance to principles, financial contribution, strategic alignment, and competitive position. The risk index should include criteria such as size and complexity, technology, organizational capacity, and impact of a failure.
