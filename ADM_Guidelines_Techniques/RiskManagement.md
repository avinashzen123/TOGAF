# 27. Risk Management

There are two levels of risk that should be considered, namely:

1. Initial Level of Risk: risk categorization prior to determining and implementing mitigating actions
2. Residual Level of Risk: risk categorization after implementation of mitigating actions (if any)

The process for risk management

* Risk classification : One common way for risks to be classified is with respect to impact on the organization, whereby risks with certain impacts have to be addressed by certain levels of governance.
Risks are normally classified as **time (schedule), cost (budget), and scope** but they could also include client transformation relationship risks, contractual risks, technological risks, scope and complexity risks, environmental (corporate) risks, personnel risks, and client acceptance risks

* Risk identification : The use of Capability Maturity Models (CMMs) is suitable for specific factors associated with architecture delivery to first identify baseline and target states and then identify the actions required to move to the target state. The implications of not achieving the target state can result in the discovery of risks.

* Initial risk assessment : The next step is to classify risks with respect to effect and frequency in accordance with scales used within the organization. Combine effect and frequency to come up with a preliminary risk assessment.

Effect would be accessed using the following example criteria:
- Catastrophic
- Critical
- Marginal
- Negligible 

Frequeency could be indicated as follows:
- Frequent 
- Likely
- Occasional 
- Seldom
- Unlikely

Combining the two factor to infer impact would be conducted using a heruistically based on Consistent classification scheme of the risk
- Extermely high risk (E)
- High risk (H)
- Moderate risk (M)
- Low risk (L)

* Risk mitigation and residual risk assessment : Risk mitigation refers to the identification, planning, and conduct of actions that will reduce the risk to an acceptable level.
The mitigation effort could be a simple monitoring and/or acceptance of the risk to a full-blown contingency plan calling for complete redundancy in a Business Continuity Plan (with all of the associated scope, cost, and time implications).

* Risk monitoring and Governance (Phase G) : The residual risks have to be approved by the IT governance framework and potentially in corporate governance where business acceptance of the residual risks is required.

Once the residual risks have been accepted, then the execution of the mitigating actions has to be carefully monitored to ensure that the enterprise is dealing with residual rather than initial risk.
