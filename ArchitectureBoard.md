# 41. Architecture Board


> A key element in a successful Architecture Governance strategy is a cross-organization Architecture Board to oversee the implementation of the strategy. This body should be representative of all the key stakeholders in the architecture, and will typically comprise a group of executives responsible for the review and maintenance of the overall architecture.

## Role
Boards typically comprise representatives from the organization at a minimum of two levels:

    - Local (domain experts, line responsibility)
    - Global (organization-wide responsibility)


## Responsibilities
The Architecture Board is typically made responsible, and accountable, for achieving some or all of the following goals:
- Provide basis for all decision making with regards to the architectures
- Consistency between sub-architectures
- Establish targets for re-use of components
- Flexibility fo EA
- Enforcement of Architecture compliance
- Improving maturity level of architecture discipline
- Ensuring that the discipline of arhcitecture development is adopted
- Supporting a visible escalation capability for out-of-bounds decision.

**Further responsibilities from an operational perspective should include:**
- All aspects of monitoring and control of architecture contract
- Metting on a regular basis
- Ensuring the effective and consistent management and implementation of the architecture.
- Resolving ambiguities, issues, or conflicts that have been escalated
- Providing advice, guidance, and information
- Ensuring compliance with the architectures, and granting dispensations that are in keeping with the technology strategy and objectives
- Considering policy (schedule, Service-Level Agreements (SLAs), etc.) changes where similar dispensations are requested and granted; e.g., new form of service requirement
- Ensuring that all information relevant to the implementation of the Architecture Contract is published under controlled conditions and made available to authorized parties
- Validation of reported service levels, cost savings, etc.

**From a governance perspective, the Architecture Board is also responsible for:**
- The production of usable governance material and activities
- Providing a mechanism for the formal acceptance and approval of architecture through consensus and authorized publication
- Providing a fundamental control mechanism for ensuring the effective implementation of the architecture
- Establishing and maintaining the link between the implementation of the architecture, the architectural strategy and objectives embodied in the Enterprise Architecture, and the strategic objectives of the business
- Identifying divergence from the architecture and planning activities for realignment through dispensations or policy updates

## Setting Up the Architecture Board
**Triggers**

    New CIO
    Merger or acquisition
    Consideration of a move to newer forms of computing
    Recognition that IT is poorly aligned to business
    Desire to achieve competitive advantage via technology
    Creation of an Enterprise Architecture program
    Significant business change or rapid growth
    Requirement for complex, cross-functional solutions


**Size of the Board** four or five (and no more than ten) permanent members.
ensuring enterprise-wide representation on it over time, membership of the Architecture Board may be rotated, giving decision-making privileges and responsibilities to various senior managers.
However, some continuity must exist on the Architecture Board, to prevent the corporate architecture from varying from one set of ideas to another.

**Board Structure**
- Global governance board
- Local governance board
- Design authorities
- Working parties

## Operation of the Architecture Board

- General : Architecture Board meetings should be conducted within clearly identified agendas with explicit objectives, content coverage, and defined actions. In general, board meetings will be aligned with best practice, such as given in the COBIT framework

- Preparation

- Preparation 
    * Minutes of Previous Meeting
    * Requests for Change : Items under this heading are normally change requests for amendments to architectures, principles, etc., but may also include business control with regard to Architecture Contracts; 
    * Dispensations
    * Compliance Assessments : Compliance is assessed against SLAs, Operational-Level Agreements (OLAs), cost targets, and required architecture refreshes. These assessments will be reviewed and either accepted or rejected depending on the criteria defined within the Architecture Governance 
    * Dispute Resolution
    * Architecture Strategy and Direction Documentation
    * Actions Assigned
    * Contract Documentation Management
    * Any Other Business (AOB)
    * Schedule of Meetings
