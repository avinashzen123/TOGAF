# 26. Business Transformation Readiness Assessment

``` Enterprise Architecture is a major endeavor within an organization and most often an innovative Architecture Vision (Phase A) and supporting Architecture Definition (Phases B to D) will entail considerable change ```

Understanding the readiness of the organization to accept change, identifying the issues, and then dealing with them in the Implementation and Migration Plans is key to successful architecture transformation in Phases E and F.


The recommended activities in an assessment of an organization's readiness to address business transformation are:

- Determine the readiness factors that will impact the organization
- ***Present the readiness factors using maturity models**
- Assess the readiness factors, including determination of readiness factor ratings
- Assess the risks for each readiness factor and identify improvement actions to mitigate the risk
- Work these actions into Phase E and F Implementation and Migration Plan


Business Transformation Enablement Program (BTEP) : Provides guideance on how to identify Business transformation related issues.

Outcome of BTEP is deeper understanding of the challanges and opportunities that could be presented in the course of the endeavor.

## Determine Readiness Factors
The first step is to determine what factors will impact on the business transformation associated with the migration from the Baseline to Target Architectures.

In this workshop it is very useful to start off with a tentative list of factors that participants can re-use, reject, augment, or replace.

An example set of factors drawn from the BTEP follows:
1. **Vision** is the ability to clearly define and communicate what is to be achieved
2. **Desire, Willingness, and Resolve** is the presence of a desire to achieve the results, willingness to accept the impact of doing the work, and the resolve to follow through and complete the endeavor
3. **Need**, in that there is a compelling need to execute the endeavor 
4. **Business Case** exists that creates a strong focus for the project, identifying benefits that must be achieved and thereby creating an imperative to succeed 
5. Funding, in the form of a clear source of fiscal resources, exists that meets the endeavor's potential expenditures
6. **Sponsorship and Leadership** exists and is broadly shared, but not so broad as to diffuse accountability 
7. **Governance** is the ability to engage the involvement and support of all parties with an interest in or responsibility to the endeavor with the objective of ensuring that the corporate interests are served and the objectives achieved 
8. **Accountability** is the assignment of specific and appropriate responsibility, recognition of measurable expectations by all concerned parties, and alignment of decision-making with areas of responsibility and with where the impact of the decisions will be felt 
9. **Workable** Approach and Execution Model is an approach that makes sense relative to the task, with a supporting environment, modeled after a proven approach 
10. **IT Capacity to Execute** is the ability to perform all the IT tasks required by the project, including the skills, tools, processes, and management capability 
11. **Enterprise Ability to Implement and Operate** the transformation elements and their related business processes, absorb the changes arising from implementation, and ongoing ability to operate in the new environment 


## Present Readiness Factors
One such presentation is through the use of maturity models. If each factor is converted into a maturity model (a re-usable governance asset as well) accompanied by a standard worksheet template containing all of the information and deductions that have to be gathered, it can be a very useful tool.

The maturity model should enable participants to:

* Assess their current (Baseline Architecture) maturity level
* Determine the target maturity level that would have to be achieved to realize the Target Architecture
* Determine an intermediate target that would be achievable in a lesser timeframe

## Assess Readiness Factors
The assessment should address three things, namely:

- Readiness Factor Vision : The vision for a readiness factor is the determination of where the enterprise has to evolve to address the factor. First, the factor should be assessed with respect to its base state and then its target state.
- Readiness Factor Rating : Once the factor visions are established, then it is useful to determine how important each factor is to the achievement of the Target Architecture as well as how challenging it will be to migrate the factor into an acceptable visionary state.
Each one of the readiness factor are rated with respect to :
    * Urgency
    * Readiness status : Low, Fair, Acceptable, Good or High
    * Degree of Difficulty to fix  : No action needed, Easy, Moderate, or difficult
- Readiness Factor Risks & Actions : actions that will enable the factors to change to a favorable state. Each factor should be discretely assessed and a series of improvement actions outlined.

## Readiness and Migration Planning
The assessment exercise will provide a realistic assessment of the organization and will be a key input into the *strategic migration planning that will be initiated in Phase E and completed in Phase F*
The readiness factors, as part of an overall Implementation and Migration Plan, will have to be continuously monitored (Phase G) and rapid corrective actions taken through the IT governance framework to ensure that the defined architectures can be implemented.


## Marketing the Implementation Plan
The Architecture Definition should not be widely circulated until the business transformation issues are identified and mitigated, and the associated actions part of an overall "marketing" plan for the vision and the Implementation and Migration Plan.
