# 43. Architecture Contracts

Architecture Contracts are the joint agreements between development partners and sponsors on the deliverables, quality, and fitness-for-purpose of an architecture. Sccessful implementation of these agreements will be delivered through effective Architecture Governance

**By implementing a governed approach to the management of contracts, the following will be ensured:**

- A system of continuous monitoring to check integrity, changes, decision-making, and audit of all architecture-related activities within the organization
- Adherence to the principles, standards, and requirements of the existing or developing architectures
- Identification of risks in all aspects of the development and implementation of the architecture(s) covering the internal development against accepted standards, policies, technologies, and products as well as the operational aspects of the architectures such that the organization can continue its business within a resilient environment
- A set of processes and practices that ensure accountability, responsibility, and discipline with regard to the development and usage of all architectural artifacts
- A formal understanding of the governance organization responsible for the contract, their level of authority, and scope of the architecture under the governance of this body

Architecture Contracts may occur at various stages of the Architecture Development Method (ADM); for example:
- The Statement of Architecture Work created in Phase A
- The development of one or more architecture domains, and in some cases the oversight of the overall Enterprise Architecture, may be contracted out to systems integrators, applications providers, and/or service providers
- At the beginning of Phase G (Implementation Governance), between the architecture function and the function responsible for implementing the Enterprise Architecture defined in the preceding ADM phases, typically, this will be either the in-house systems development function, or a major contractor to whom the work is outsourced 
- When the Enterprise Architecture has been implemented (at the end of Phase G), an Architecture Contract will normally be drawn up between the architecting function (or the IT governance function, subsuming the architecting function) and the business users who will subsequently be building and deploying application systems in the architected environment


## Contents
**Statement of Architecture Work**
**Contract between Architecture Design and Development Partners**
Typical contents of an Architecture Design and Development Contract are:

- Introduction and background
- The nature of the agreement
- Scope of the architecture
- Architecture and strategic principles and requirements
- Conformance requirements
- Architecture development and management process and roles
- Target architecture measures
- Defined phases of deliverables
- Prioritized joint workplan
- Time window(s)
- Architecture delivery and business metrics

**Contract between Architecting Function and Business Users**
This is a signed statement of intent to conform with the Enterprise Architecture, issued by enterprise business users. When the Enterprise Architecture has been implemented (at the end of Phase F), an Architecture Contract will normally be drawn up between the architecting function (or the IT governance function, subsuming the architecting function) and the business users who will subsequently be building and deploying application systems in the architected environment.

Typical contents of a Business Users' Architecture Contract are:

- Introduction and background
- The nature of the agreement
- Scope
- Strategic requirements
- Architecture deliverables that meet the business requirements
- Conformance requirements
- Architecture adopters
- Time window
- Architecture business metrics
- Service architecture (includes Service-Level Agreement (SLA))


**Relationship to Architecture Governance**
The Architecture Contract document produced in Phase G of the ADM figures prominently in the area of Architecture Governance
In the context of Architecture Governance, the Architecture Contract is often used as a means of driving architecture change.

In order to ensure that the Architecture Contract is effective and efficient, the following aspects of the governance framework may need to be introduced into Phase G:

- Simple processes
- People-centered authority
- Strong communication
- Timely responses and an effective escalation process
- Supporting organizational structures
- Status tracking of architecture implementation
