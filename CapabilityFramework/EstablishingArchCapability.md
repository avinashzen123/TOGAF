As with any business capability, the establishment of an Enterprise Architecture Capability can be supported by the TOGAF Architecture Development Method (ADM).

Applying the ADM with the specific Architecture Vision to establish an architecture practice within the organization would achieve this objective.

Implementing any capability within an organization would require the design of the four domain architectures
- Business architecture : architecture practice that will highlight the Architecture Governance, architecture processes, architecture organizational structure, architecture information requirements, architecture products, etc.
- Data architecture : define the structure of the organization's Enterprise Continuum and Architecture Repository
- Application architecutre : specifying the functionality and/or applications services required to enable the architecture practice
- Technology architecture : Depicts the architecture practice's infrastructure requirements and deployment in support of the architecture applications and Enterprise Continuum

#### The steps in establishing an architecture practice are explained below, against the context of the ADM phases

1. Phase A : Architecture vision :- define or review the vision, stakeholders, and principles of the architecture practice
    * Establish the Project : this step should focus on defining the stakeholders in the architecture practice 
    * Identify Stakeholders and Concerns, Business Requirements, and Architecture Vision : this step generates the first, very high-level definitions of the baseline and target environments, from a business information systems and technology perspective for the architecture practice
    * Identify Business goals and Business drivers : an understanding of the business goals and drivers is essential to align the architecture practice to the business
    * Define scope : high-level project plan of what should be addressed in terms of architecture for the next period
    * Define constraint : enterprise-wide constraints that would impact on all architecture projects
    * Review Architecture principles, including business principles : define the principles that would govern and guide the running of the architecture practice 
    * Develop Statement of architecture work and secure Approval : should generate the architecture practice vision and scope

2. Phase B : Business architecture : 
    * Architecture Ontology 
    * Architecture Process
    * Architecture viewoints and view : list all the viewpoints and views that should be addressed by the architecture practice 
    * Architecture framework : describing the various architecture deliverables that will be generated by the architecture practice, the inter-relationships and dependencies between the architecture deliverables, as well as the rules and guidelines governing the design of these deliverables 
    * Arechitecture accountabilty matrix : defining the roles in the architecture practice and allocating accountability of the roles to architecture deliverables and processes 
    * Architecture performance matrix : Metrics identifying and describing the metrics that will be used to monitor the performance of the architecture practice against its stated architecture practice vision and objectives
    * Architecture governance framework : specific view of the defined architecture process and Architecture Accountability Matrix

3. Phase C: Data architecture : specify and govern the structure of the organization's Enterprise Continuum and Architecture Repository.

4. Phase C: Application Architecture : defines the functionality required to generate, maintain, publish, distribute, and govern the architecture deliverables as defined in the architecture framework. A key focus should be on the modeling toolsets required for modeling

5. Phase D: Technology Architecture : define technology infrastructure supporting the architecture practice.

6. Phase E: Opportunities & Solutions : organizational change that is required and how this will be achieved.

7. Phase F: Migration Planning : The focus should not only be on the Information Systems Architecture components in this phase, but include the Business Architecture. The adoption of the architecture process and framework will have a major impact on the overall establishment of the architecture practice in the organization.

8. Phase G: Implementation Governance : The implementation of the Business Architecture of the architecture practice should be the focus of this phase. Changing practices within the organization to adopt a more structured and disciplined approach will be a challenge and should be addressed by the appropriate organizational change techniques. 

9. Phase H: Architecture Change Management : Changes to the architecture of the architecture practice should be managed by this phase

10. Requirements Management
