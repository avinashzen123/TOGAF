# 45 : Architecture Maturity Models

Capability Maturity Models (CMM) : provides an effective and proven method for organisation to gradually gain control over and improve it change process.

- They describe the practices that any organization must perform in order to improve its processes
- They provide a yardstick against which to periodically measure improvement
- They constitute a proven framework within which to manage the improvement efforts
- They organize the various practices into levels, each level representing an increased ability to control and manage the development environment

An evaluation of the organization’s practices against the model — called an "assessment" — determines the level at which the organization currently stands.

The main issues addressed by these models include:
- Process implementation and audit
- Quality measurements
- People competencies
- Investment management

**The DoC ACMM consists of six maturity levels and nine architecture elements. The six levels are:**
0. None
1. Initial
2. Under development
3. Defined
4. Managed
5. Measured

**The nine architecture elements are** :
1. Architecture process
2. Architecture development
3. Business linkage
4. Senior management involvement
5. Operating unit participation
6. Architecture communication
7. IT Security
8. Architecture governance
9. IT investment and acquisition strategy.


None : No enterprise archiecture program.

**Initial** :
1. Process are ad hoc and localized. No unified archiecture process across technologies or business process. Success depend on individual efforts.
2. Enterprise architectur process, documentation and standard are established by variety of ad hoc means and are localized or informal
3. Minimal or implicit linkage to business strategy or business driver
4. Limited management team awareness or involvement in the architecture process.
5. Limited operating unit acceptance of EA Process
6. The latest version of the operating unit's EA documentation is on the web. Little communication exists about the EA Process and possible process improvements.
7. IT Security consideration are ad hoc and localized.
8. No explicit governance or architectural standard.
9. Little or no invovlement of strategic planning and acquisition personnel in EA process. Little or no adherence to existing standard.

**Under Development** :
1. Basic EA process is document
2. IT Vision, principles, business linkage , baseline and target architecture are identified. Architecture standard exists but not necessarity liked to target architecture. Technical reference model (TRM) and Standards profile framework established.
3. Explicit linkage to business strategy
4. Management awareness of architecture effort.
5. Responsibiliites are assigned and work is underway.
6. The DoC and operating unit EA web pages are updated periodically and are used to document architecture deliverables.
7. IT Security architecture has defined clear roles and responsbilities.
8. Governance of a few architectural standard and some adherence to existing standards profile.
9. Little or no formal governance of IT Investment and acquisition strategy. Operating unit demonstrates some adherence to existing standard profile.


**Defined** : 
1. The architecture is well define dand communicated to TI Staff and business management with Operating unit IT responsibilities. The process is largely followed.
2. Gap analysis and migration plan are completed. Fully Developed TRM and Standard profile. IT Goals ans methods are identified.
3. EA is integrated with capital planning and investment method
4. Senior management team aware and supporting of Enterprise wide architecture process. Management actively supports architectural method.
5. Most elements of operating unit show acceptance of or actively partifipating in the EA Process.
6. Architecture documents updated regularly on DoC EA web page.
7. IT Security architecture standard profile is fully developed and is integrated with EA.
8. Explicit documented governance of majority of IT investment
9. It acquisition strategy exists and includes compliance measures to IT enterprise architecture. Cost benefit are considered in identifying projects.

**Manged** :
1. EA Process is part of culture. Quality metrics associated with Architecture process are captured.
2. EA documentation is updated on a regular cycle to reflect the updated EA, Business, data, application and technology architecture defined by appropritate de jure and de facto standard.
3. Capital planning and investment control are adjusted based on feedback received and lesson learned from updated EA. Periodically re-examination of business drivers.
4. Senior management team direclty involved in architecture review porcess.
5. The entire operating unit accepts and actively participate in EA process
6. Architecture documents are updated regularly, and frequently reviewed for latest architecture developments/standards.
7. Performance metrics associated with IT security architecture are captured.
8. Explicit governance of all IT investments. Formal processes for managing variances feed back into Enterprise Architecture.
9. All planned IT acquisitions and purchases are guided and governed by the Enterprise Architecture.


**Measured** :
1. Concerted efforts to optimize and continuously improve architecture process.
2. A standards and waivers process is used to improve architecture development process.
3. Architecture process metrics are used to optimize and drive business linkages. Business involved in the continuous process improvements of Enterprise Architecture.
4. Senior management involvement in optimizing process improvements in architecture development and governance.
5. Feedback on architecture process from all operating unit elements is used to drive architecture process improvements.
6. Architecture documents are used by every decision-maker in the organization for every IT-related business decision.
7. Feedback from IT security architecture metrics are used to drive architecture process improvements.
8. Explicit governance of all IT investments. A standards and waivers process is used to make governance-process improvements.
9. No unplanned IT investment or acquisition activity.
