# 32. Architecture Deliverables

**Architecture building blocks** Architecture documentation and models from enterprise's architecture repository.

**Solution Building Blocks** : Implementation-specific building blocks from the enterprise’s Architecture Repository

**Architeture contract** Are joint agreements between development partners and sponsors on the deliverables, quality and fitness for purpose of an architecture.
By Implementing governed approach to management of cotracts, the following will be ensured.

- A system of continious monitoring to check integrity, changes, decision makeing and audit of all architecture related activities within the organization.
- Adherence to the principles, standards and rquirement of existing or developing architecture.
- Identification of risk in all aspects fo the development and implementation of the architecture covering the internal development against accepted standard, policies, technologies and products as well as the operational aspects of the architectures such that the organization can continue its business within a resilient environments.
- A set of processes and practices that ensure accountability, responsibility and discipline with regard to the development and usage of all architectural artifacts.
- A formal understanding of the governance organization responsible for the contract, their level of authority and scope of architecutre under the governance of this body.

**Architecture definition document** : Is the deliverable container for core architectural artifacts created during a project and for important related information.
Provides qualitative view of the solution and aims to communicate the intent of the architecture.

**Architecture requirement specification** : A set of quntitative statement that outlines what an implementation project must do in order to comply with the architecture. Will form major component of implementation contract or contract for more detailed architecture definition.
Architecture requirements specification provides a quantitative view of the solution, stating measurable criteria that must be met during the implementation of the architecture.

**Arhitecture principle** : Principles are general rules and guidelines, intended to be enduring and seldom amended that inform and support way in which an organization sets about fulfulling its mission.

**Architecture repository** : Act as a holding area for all architecture related project within the enterprise. The repository allow project to manage their deliverables, locate re-usable assets and publish outputs to stakeholders and other interested parties.


**Architecture roadmap** : Lists individual work packages that will realize the Target architecture and lays them on a timeline to show progression from the Baseline architecture to target architectur.

The architecture roadmap is incrementally developed throught Phases E and F and informed by readily identifiable roadmap components from Phas B, C and D within ADM

**Architecture Vision** : The Architecture Vision is created early on in the ADM cycle. It provides a summary of the changes to the enterprise that will accrue from successful deployment of the Target Architecture.
The purpose of the Architecture Vision is to provide key stakeholders with a formally agreed outcome. 

Content
Typical contents of an Architecture Vision are:
-  Problem description:
    — Stakeholders and their concerns
    — List of issues/scenarios to be addressed
-  Objective of the Statement of Architecture Work
-  Summary views necessary for the Request for Architecture Work and the Version 0.1 Business, Application, Data, and Technology Architectures created; typically including:
    — Value Chain diagram
    — Solution Concept diagram
-  Mapped requirements
-  Reference to Draft Architecture Definition Document


**Business Principles, Business Goals, and Business Drivers** : Business principles, business goals, and business drivers provide context for architecture work, by describing the needs and ways of working employed by the enterprise. 

**CapabilityAssessment** : Before embarking upon a detailed Architecture Definition, it is valuable to understand the baseline and target capability level of the enterprise. 

**Change Request** : During implementation of an architecture, as more facts become known, it is possible that the original Architecture Definition and requirements are not suitable or are not sufficient to complete the implementation of a solution. In these circumstances, it is necessary for implementation projects to either deviate from the suggested architectural approach or to request scope extensions. Additionally, external factors — such as market factors, changes in business strategy, and new technology opportunities — may open up opportunities to extend and refine the architecture.


**CommunicationsPlan** : Effective communication of targeted information to the right stakeholders at the right time is a Critical Success Factor (CSF) for Enterprise Architecture. Development of a Communications Plan for architecture allows for this communication to be carried out within a planned and managed process.

-  Identification of stakeholders and grouping by communication requirements
-  Identification of communication needs, key messages in relation to the Architecture Vision, communication risks, and CSFs
-  Identification of mechanisms that will be used to communicate with stakeholders and allow access to architecture information, such as meetings, newsletters, repositories, etc.
-  Identification of a communications timetable, showing which communications will occur with which stakeholder groups at what time and in what location

**Compliance Assessment** : Once an architecture has been defined, it is necessary to govern that architecture through implementation to ensure that the original Architecture Vision is appropriately realized and that any implementation learnings are fed back into the architecture process. Periodic compliance reviews of implementation projects provide a mechanism to review project progress and ensure that the design and implementation is proceeding in line with the strategic and architectural objectives.

**Implementation and Migration Plan** : The Implementation and Migration Plan provides a schedule of the projects that will realize the Target Architecture. The Implementation and Migration Plan includes executable projects grouped into managed portfolios and programs. The Implementation and Migration Strategy identifying the approach to change is a key element of the Implementation and Migration Plan.

**Implementation Governance Model** : Once an architecture has been defined, it is necessary to plan how the Transition Architecture that implements the architecture will be governed through implementation. Within organizations that have established architecture functions, there is likely to be a governance framework already in place, but specific processes, organizations, roles, responsibilities, and measures may need to be defined on a project-by-project basis.

**Organizational Model for Enterprise Architecture** : In order for an architecture framework to be used successfully, it must be supported by the correct organization, roles, and responsibilities within the enterprise. Of particular importance is the definition of boundaries between different Enterprise Architecture practitioners and the governance relationships that span across these boundaries.

**Request for Architecture Work** :  This is a document that is sent from the sponsoring organization to the architecture organization to trigger the start of an architecture development cycle. Requests for Architecture Work can be created as an output of the Preliminary Phase, a result of approved architecture Change Requests, or terms of reference for architecture work originating from migration planning.

**Requirements Impact Assessment** : A Requirements Impact Assessment assesses the current architecture requirements and specification to identify changes that should be made and the implications of those changes.

**Statement of Architecture Work** : The Statement of Architecture Work defines the scope and approach that will be used to complete an architecture development cycle. The Statement of Architecture Work is typically the document against which successful execution of the architecture project will be measured and may form the basis for a contractual agreement between the supplier and consumer of architecture services.

**Tailored Architecture Framework** :
