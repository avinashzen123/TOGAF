The Business Architecture phase, focuses on documenting and analyzing the business structure, including customers' (or viewers') behavior, processes, and strategies
Phase B focuses on the business architecture, which includes understanding user roles, interactions, and processes that drive the organization's goals


Phase C deals with the definition of information systems, including their detailed requirements. This phase would be best suited for gathering and documenting the requirements for the digitalization of the library archives.

Application Architecture would define how applications are structured and interact. Implementing AI-driven chatbots would primarily involve changes and additions to the application layer, defining how the chatbots operate and integrate with other systems.


Phase D: Technology Architecture phase, the focus is on mapping application components defined in Phase C to the technology components
Phase D aims to define and organize the architecture of the technology components, ensuring it supports the wider enterprise architecture.
Phase D aims at defining the technology environment by detailing the platforms, tools, and technology standards
In Phase D, the focus is on designing the technology architecture, which includes determining necessary interfaces, protocols, and infrastructural components.
Phase D is focused on the design and strategy of the technology layer, which includes identifying new technology solutions like IoT in this context.
Phase D focuses on the technological aspects of the architecture, including the evaluation of architectural patterns like microservices.
In Phase D, the architecture for the technology platform is created, addressing the decision-making regarding technological solutions and integration.


In Phase E, one would identify major implementation projects and opportunities, as well as potential solutions that address these, including defining the operational limits and constraints.
In Phase E, the architecture is translated into real-world opportunities and solutions. This phase would deal with the evaluation and selection of products and services to fulfill architectural requirements.
In Phase E, various architectural opportunities and solutions are evaluated for their feasibility and alignment with the business objectives.
In Phase E, opportunities and solutions are identified to address specific business drivers, requirements, and gaps.


Phase F, Migration Planning, deals with planning the changes necessary to move from the Baseline to the Target Architecture, including consolidating global IT infrastructure across regions.

Phase G focuses on overseeing the implementation and ensuring that it aligns with the architectural vision and meets the organization's requirements.
In Phase G, the emphasis is on ensuring that the implementation projects conform to the defined architecture, and this includes managing and addressing risks.
