What is Architecture in the Context of TOGAF?
``` 
A formal description of a system, or a detailed plan of the system at a component level to guide its implementation or the structure of components, their inter-relationships, and the principles and guidelines governing their design and evolution over time
```

Which of the following according to TOGAF is a reason to use an Enterprise Architecture Framework?
``` 
    It will speed up and simplify architecture development
    It will ensure more complete coverage of the designed solution
    It will make certain that the architecture selected allows for future growth in response to the needs of the business
    Its use may be mandated by federal agencies

Benefits of Architecture Governance
```
Increased transparency of accountability, and informed delegation of authority
Controlled risk management
Protection of the existing asset base through maximizing re-use of existing architectural components
Proactive control, monitoring, and management mechanisms
Process, concept, and component re-use across all organizational business units
Value creation through monitoring, measuring, evaluation, and feedback
Increased visibility supporting internal processes and external parties’ requirements; in particular, increased visibility of decision-making at lower levels ensures oversight at an appropriate level within the enterprise of decisions that may have far-reaching strategic consequences for the organization
Greater shareholder value; in particular, Enterprise Architecture increasingly represents the core intellectual property of the enterprise — studies have demonstrated a correlation between increased shareholder value and well-governed enterprises
```

Part of Architecture Governance?
```
    Implementing a system of controls over the creation and monitoring of all architectural components and activities
    Implementing a system to ensure compliance with internal and external standards and regulatory obligations
    Establishing processes that support effective management of the above processes within agreed parameters
    Developing practices that ensure accountability to a clearly identified stakeholder community 
```

Reason for wanting to tailor ADM for the specific need of the enterprise
```
An enterprise may wish to use or tailor the ADM in conjunction with the marketing strategy
The ADM is one of many corporate processes that make up the corporate governance model for an enterprise
The ADM is being mandated for use by a prime or lead contractor in an outsourcing situation, and needs to be tailored to achieve a suitable compromise between the contractor’s existing practices and the contracting enterprise’s requirements
The enterprise is a small-to-medium enterprise, and wishes to use a “cut-down” version of the ADM 
```

What does the Conceptual Structure of Architecture Governance Framework contain?
```
    Process, Content, Repository and Process Flow Control
```

What is a Standards Information Base
```
It holds a set of specifications, to which architectures must conform
```

How is the Transition Architecture formulated
```
In Phase E major implementation projects grouped into Transition Architectures and they are confirmed with relevant stakeholders in phase F
```

How is the Architecture Governance performed
```
It is established in Preliminary Phase and operated on Phase G and H
```

Business Scenario describes
```
    A business process, application, or set of applications
    The business and technology environment
    The people and computing components who execute the scenario
    The desired outcome of proper execution 
```

Security considerations of information and service exchanges determined in 
```
    Phase A
```

Technique for discovering the need for a Capability
``` 
Business Scenario 
```

Purpose of Architecture Compliance Review
```
    To identify where the standards themselves may require modification
    To identify services that are currently application-specific but might be provided as part of the enterprise infrastructure
    To document strategies for collaboration, resource sharing, and other synergies across multiple architecture teams
    To take advantage of advances in technology 
```

Recommended step to create the required views for a particular architecture
```
    Refer to any existing libraries of viewpoints
    Select key stakeholders
    Select appropriate viewpoints
    Generate views of the system using the selected viewpoints as templates 
```

Scope of governance of Architecture Contract
```
    Continuous monitoring to check integrity
    Adherence to the principles and standards
    Identification of risks
    Ensuring accountability, responsibility, and discipline 
```


In which phase is Capability Assessment carried out
```
It is first carried out in Phase A and updated in Phase E
```
Which of the following describes the Phase H classification for an Incremental change?

What is the TOGAF Technical Reference Model?
```
It describes a fundamental architecture upon which other, more specific, architectures can be based

The objective of the TGF TRM is to provide a widely accepted core taxonomy, and an appropriate visual representation of that taxonomy.
```

Part of the Integrated Information Infrastructure Reference Model taxonomy
```
    Information consumer application
    Management utilities
    Communication infrastructure interface
    Information provider application 
```

> III-RM is example of application architecture,It is fundamentally an Applications Architecture reference model - a model of the application components and application services software essential for an integrated information infrastructure.

> The TGF Integrated Information Infrastructure Reference Model (III-RM) is a reference model that supports describing Common Systems Architecture in the Application Domain that focuses on the requirements, building blocks, and standards relating to the vision of Boundaryless Information Flow

Aspect of phase A
```
    Develop a high-level aspirational vision of the capabilities and business value to be delivered as a result of the proposed Enterprise Architecture
    Assess Readiness for Business Transformation
    Obtain approval for a Statement of Architecture Work that defines a program of works to develop and deploy the architecture outlined in the Architecture Vision 6.2 Inputs
    Identify Stakeholders, Concerns, and Business Requirements
```

What describes the Phase H classification for an Incremental change?

```
A simplification change to an architecture is often driven by a requirement to reduce investment; an incremental change, by a requirement to derive additional value from existing investment; a re-architecting change, by a requirement to increase investment in order to create new value for exploitation.
```

> One of the outputs of Phase-D is "Technology platforms and their decomposition, showing the combinations of technology required to realize a particular technology stack
> The Technology Architecture describes the logical software and hardware capabilities that are required to support the deployment of business, data, and application services; this includes IT infrastructure, middleware, networks, communications, processing, standards, etc.

Top down vs Botton up approach
```
The top-down approach means that you start with the business requirements (the B layer) and fully decide the problems your business needs to solve before thinking about the technology to solve those problems. The “bottom up” approach means you start with the technology that you are looking to add to your organization and work “up” to change the applications and the business.

An example of this is, let’s say you have a problem with security. You talk to the business leaders, department heads, etc and come up with an extensive target business architecture for it. Then you start looking at vendors and thinking about implementation. That’s top-down.

The bottom-up approach is, when you have a problem with security, talking to the technical teams and ops teams. What can you do to improve security? They might suggest you restrict all access from outside your company except through the VPN. You then work up to the business layer to say that certain policies need to be followed to get access to the company network from outside. That’s a top up approach. Thinking about solutions first and then changing the business needs to match.
```

> The ADM numbering scheme is provided as an example. It should be adapted by the architect to meet the requirements of the organization and to work with the architecture tools and repositories employed by the organization

```
There are three main categories of architecture change:
1. Simplification: this can be handled via change management techniques.
2. Incremental: this may be handled via change management techniques, or it may require partial rearchitecting.
3. Re-architecting: this requires putting the whole architecture through the architecture development cycle again.
