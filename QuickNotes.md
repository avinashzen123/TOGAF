**What is Architecture in the Context of TOGAF?**
> A formal description of a system, or a detailed plan of the system at a component level to guide its implementation or the structure of components, their inter-relationships, and the principles and guidelines governing their design and evolution over time
 

**Which of the following according to TOGAF is a reason to use an Enterprise Architecture Framework?**  
It will speed up and simplify architecture development.  
It will ensure more complete coverage of the designed solution.  
It will make certain that the architecture selected allows for future growth in response to the needs of the business.  
Its use may be mandated by federal agencies.  

**six parts of TOGAF document**
1. Introduction
2. ADM
3. ADM Guidelines and techniques
4. Architecture content framework
5. Architecture Continuum and tools
6. Architecture capability framework.


The **Statement of Architecture Work** in TOGAF defines the scope and approach to complete an architecture project, acts as a contract between the development team and the sponsors, and identifies the key stakeholders and their requirements.  

**Part of Architecture Repository** 
1. Architecture Metamodel
2. Architecture Capability
3. Architecture Landscape
4. Standards Information Base
5. Reference Library
6. Governance Log
7. Architecture Requirements Repository
8. Solutions Landscape

**Architecture Landscape**
1. Strategic Architectures : show a long-term summary view of the entire enterprise. Strategic Architectures provide an organizing framework for operational and change activity and allow for direction setting at an executive level.
2. Segment Architectures : provide more detailed operating models for areas within an enterprise. Segment Architectures can be used at the program or portfolio level to organize and operationally align more detailed change activity.
3. Capability Architectures : show in a more detailed fashion how the enterprise can support a particular unit of capability. Capability Architectures are used to provide an overview of current capability, target capability, and capability increments and allow for individual work packages and projects to be grouped within managed portfolios and programs
 

**Reference materials held may be obtained from a variety of sources, including:**   
    Standards bodies  
    Product and service vendors   
    Industry communities or forums  
    Standard templates  
    Enterprise best practice

**Type of standards**:
1. Legal and Regulatory Obligations
2. Industry Standards
3. Organizational Standards


**Standards Lifecycle**
- Proposed Standard
- Provisional Standard
- Standard (also known as an Active Standard):
- Phasing-Out Standard (also known as a Deprecated Standard)
- Retired Standard (also known as an Obsolete Standard):

**What is a Standards Information Base** : It holds a set of specifications, to which architectures must conform

**Standards Classification within the Standards Information Base** :
- Business Standards
- Data Standards
- Applications Standards
- Technology Standards

**The Reference Library should contain:** 
    Reference Architectures
    Reference Models
    Viewpoint Library

> TRM is used for Foundation architecture.

**Benefits of Architecture Governance**
1. Increased transparency of accountability, and informed delegation of authority
2. Controlled risk management
3. Protection of the existing asset base through maximizing re-use of existing architectural components
4. Proactive control, monitoring, and management mechanisms
5. Process, concept, and component re-use across all organizational business units
6. Value creation through monitoring, measuring, evaluation, and feedback
7. Increased visibility supporting internal processes and external parties’ requirements; in particular, increased visibility of decision-making at lower levels ensures oversight at an appropriate level within the enterprise of decisions that may have far-reaching strategic consequences for the organization
8. Greater shareholder value; in particular, Enterprise Architecture increasingly represents the core intellectual property of the enterprise — studies have demonstrated a correlation between increased shareholder value and well-governed enterprises
 

**Part of Architecture Governance?** :   
    Implementing a system of controls over the creation and monitoring of all architectural components and activities
    Implementing a system to ensure compliance with internal and external standards and regulatory obligations
    Establishing processes that support effective management of the above processes within agreed parameters
    Developing practices that ensure accountability to a clearly identified stakeholder community 
 

**Governance Log** :The Governance Log provides a repository area to hold shared information relating to the ongoing governance of projects. 
Content : 
- Decision Log
- Compliance Assessments : at key checkpoint milestones in the progress of a project, a formal architecture review will be carried out 
- Capability Assessments : depending on their objectives, some projects will carry out assessments of business, IT, or Architecture Capability 
- Calendar : the Calendar should show a schedule of in-flight projects and formal review sessions to be held against these projects 
- Project Portfolio : Project Portfolio should hold summary information about all in-flight projects that fall under Architecture Governance
- Performance Measurement : based on a charter for the architecture function, a number of performance criteria will typically be defined 

Reason for wanting to tailor ADM for the specific need of the enterprise
- An enterprise may wish to use or tailor the ADM in conjunction with the marketing strategy  
- The ADM is one of many corporate processes that make up the corporate governance model for an enterprise  
- The ADM is being mandated for use by a prime or lead contractor in an outsourcing situation, and needs to be tailored to achieve a suitable compromise between the contractor’s existing  practices and the contracting enterprise’s requirements   
- The enterprise is a small-to-medium enterprise, and wishes to use a “cut-down” version of the ADM 
 



Which of the following is NOT the characteristic of a good building block?
    It considers implementation and usage, and evolves to exploit technology and standards
    It may be assembled from other building blocks
    It may be a subassembly of other building blocks
    Ideally, a building block is re-usable and replaceable, and well specified with stable interfaces

In which phase is Capability Assessment carried out
 
It is first carried out in Phase A and updated in Phase E
 
Which of the following describes the Phase H classification for an Incremental change?

What is the TOGAF Technical Reference Model?
 
It describes a fundamental architecture upon which other, more specific, architectures can be based

The objective of the TGF TRM is to provide a widely accepted core taxonomy, and an appropriate visual representation of that taxonomy.
 

Part of the Integrated Information Infrastructure Reference Model taxonomy
 
    Information consumer application
    Management utilities
    Communication infrastructure interface
    Information provider application 
 

> III-RM is example of application architecture,It is fundamentally an Applications Architecture reference model - a model of the application components and application services software essential for an integrated information infrastructure.

> The TGF Integrated Information Infrastructure Reference Model (III-RM) is a reference model that supports describing Common Systems Architecture in the Application Domain that focuses on the requirements, building blocks, and standards relating to the vision of Boundaryless Information Flow

Aspect of phase A
 
    Develop a high-level aspirational vision of the capabilities and business value to be delivered as a result of the proposed Enterprise Architecture
    Assess Readiness for Business Transformation
    Obtain approval for a Statement of Architecture Work that defines a program of works to develop and deploy the architecture outlined in the Architecture Vision 6.2 Inputs
    Identify Stakeholders, Concerns, and Business Requirements
 

What describes the Phase H classification for an Incremental change?

 
A simplification change to an architecture is often driven by a requirement to reduce investment; an incremental change, by a requirement to derive additional value from existing investment; a re-architecting change, by a requirement to increase investment in order to create new value for exploitation.
 

> One of the outputs of Phase-D is "Technology platforms and their decomposition, showing the combinations of technology required to realize a particular technology stack
> The Technology Architecture describes the logical software and hardware capabilities that are required to support the deployment of business, data, and application services; this includes IT infrastructure, middleware, networks, communications, processing, standards, etc.

Top down vs Botton up approach
 
The top-down approach means that you start with the business requirements (the B layer) and fully decide the problems your business needs to solve before thinking about the technology to solve those problems. The “bottom up” approach means you start with the technology that you are looking to add to your organization and work “up” to change the applications and the business.

An example of this is, let’s say you have a problem with security. You talk to the business leaders, department heads, etc and come up with an extensive target business architecture for it. Then you start looking at vendors and thinking about implementation. That’s top-down.

The bottom-up approach is, when you have a problem with security, talking to the technical teams and ops teams. What can you do to improve security? They might suggest you restrict all access from outside your company except through the VPN. You then work up to the business layer to say that certain policies need to be followed to get access to the company network from outside. That’s a top up approach. Thinking about solutions first and then changing the business needs to match.
 

> The ADM numbering scheme is provided as an example. It should be adapted by the architect to meet the requirements of the organization and to work with the architecture tools and repositories employed by the organization

 
There are three main categories of architecture change:
1. Simplification: this can be handled via change management techniques.
2. Incremental: this may be handled via change management techniques, or it may require partial rearchitecting.
3. Re-architecting: this requires putting the whole architecture through the architecture development cycle again.

    - Risks
    - Issues
    - Assumptions 
    - Dependencies 
    - Actions
    - Impacts

2. Consolidated Gaps, Solutions, & Dependencies Matrix : The technique of creating a Consolidated Gaps, Solutions, and Dependencies matrix allows the architect to group the gaps identified in the domain architecture gap analysis results and assess potential solutions and dependencies to one or more gaps

3. Architecture Definition Increments Table : The technique of creating an Architecture Definition Increments table allows the architect to plan a series of Transition Architectures outlining the status of the Enterprise Architecture at specified times

4. Transition Architecture State Evolution Table : The technique of creating the Transition Architecture State Evolution table allows the architect to show the proposed state of the architectures at various levels using the defined taxonomy (e.g., the TOGAF TRM).

5. Business Value Assessment Technique : A technique to assess business value is to draw up a matrix based on a value index dimension and a risk index dimension.



**All Solution Building Blocks (SBBs) should be described with respect to their delivery and impact on these services**. They should also be marked to show the progression of the Enterprise Architecture.

**Architecture Building Blocks (ABBs)** in TOGAF are used to represent architecture concepts that are applicable to architecture domains. They are typically expressed at a high level of abstraction and detail what is required from specific architecture domains to realize the system.


**According to TOGAF Document Categorization Model, which are the four categories of content?**
