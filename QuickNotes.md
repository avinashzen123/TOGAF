What is Architecture in the Context of TOGAF?
``` 
A formal description of a system, or a detailed plan of the system at a component level to guide its implementation or the structure of components, their inter-relationships, and the principles and guidelines governing their design and evolution over time
```

Which of the following according to TOGAF is a reason to use an Enterprise Architecture Framework?
``` 
    It will speed up and simplify architecture development
    It will ensure more complete coverage of the designed solution
    It will make certain that the architecture selected allows for future growth in response to the needs of the business
    Its use may be mandated by federal agencies

    Standards Information Base
    Reference Library
    Governance Log
    Architecture Requirements Repository
    Solutions Landscape
```


Architecture Landscape
```
    Strategic Architectures
    Segment Architectures
    Capability Architectures
```

Reference materials held may be obtained from a variety of sources, including:
```
    Standards bodies
    Product and service vendors
    Industry communities or forums
    Standard templates
    Enterprise best practice
```

The Reference Library should contain:
```
    Reference Architectures
    Reference Models
    Viewpoint Library
    Templates
```

Benefits of Architecture Governance
```
Increased transparency of accountability, and informed delegation of authority
Controlled risk management
Protection of the existing asset base through maximizing re-use of existing architectural components
Proactive control, monitoring, and management mechanisms
Process, concept, and component re-use across all organizational business units
Value creation through monitoring, measuring, evaluation, and feedback
Increased visibility supporting internal processes and external parties’ requirements; in particular, increased visibility of decision-making at lower levels ensures oversight at an appropriate level within the enterprise of decisions that may have far-reaching strategic consequences for the organization
Greater shareholder value; in particular, Enterprise Architecture increasingly represents the core intellectual property of the enterprise — studies have demonstrated a correlation between increased shareholder value and well-governed enterprises
```

Part of Architecture Governance?
```
    Implementing a system of controls over the creation and monitoring of all architectural components and activities
    Implementing a system to ensure compliance with internal and external standards and regulatory obligations
    Establishing processes that support effective management of the above processes within agreed parameters
    Developing practices that ensure accountability to a clearly identified stakeholder community 
```

Reason for wanting to tailor ADM for the specific need of the enterprise
```
An enterprise may wish to use or tailor the ADM in conjunction with the marketing strategy
The ADM is one of many corporate processes that make up the corporate governance model for an enterprise
The ADM is being mandated for use by a prime or lead contractor in an outsourcing situation, and needs to be tailored to achieve a suitable compromise between the contractor’s existing practices and the contracting enterprise’s requirements
The enterprise is a small-to-medium enterprise, and wishes to use a “cut-down” version of the ADM 
```

What does the Conceptual Structure of Architecture Governance Framework contain?
```
    Process, Content, Repository and Process Flow Control
```

What is a Standards Information Base
```
It holds a set of specifications, to which architectures must conform
```

How is the Transition Architecture formulated
```
In Phase E major implementation projects grouped into Transition Architectures and they are confirmed with relevant stakeholders in phase F
```

How is the Architecture Governance performed
```
It is established in Preliminary Phase and operated on Phase G and H
```

Business Scenario describes
```
    A business process, application, or set of applications
    The business and technology environment
    The people and computing components who execute the scenario
    The desired outcome of proper execution 
```

Security considerations of information and service exchanges determined in 
```
    Phase A
```

Technique for discovering the need for a Capability
``` 
Business Scenario 
```

Purpose of Architecture Compliance Review
```
    To identify where the standards themselves may require modification
    To identify services that are currently application-specific but might be provided as part of the enterprise infrastructure
    To document strategies for collaboration, resource sharing, and other synergies across multiple architecture teams
    To take advantage of advances in technology 
```

Recommended step to create the required views for a particular architecture
```
    Refer to any existing libraries of viewpoints
    Select key stakeholders
    Select appropriate viewpoints
    Generate views of the system using the selected viewpoints as templates 
```

Scope of governance of Architecture Contract
```
    Continuous monitoring to check integrity
    Adherence to the principles and standards
    Identification of risks
    Ensuring accountability, responsibility, and discipline 
```


In which phase is Capability Assessment carried out
```
It is first carried out in Phase A and updated in Phase E
```

What is the TOGAF Technical Reference Model?
```
It describes a fundamental architecture upon which other, more specific, architectures can be based
```

Part of the Integrated Information Infrastructure Reference Model taxonomy
```
    Information consumer application
    Management utilities
    Communication infrastructure interface
    Information provider application 
```

Aspect of phase A
```
    Develop a high-level aspirational vision of the capabilities and business value to be delivered as a result of the proposed Enterprise Architecture
    Assess Readiness for Business Transformation
    Obtain approval for a Statement of Architecture Work that defines a program of works to develop and deploy the architecture outlined in the Architecture Vision 6.2 Inputs
    Identify Stakeholders, Concerns, and Business Requirements
